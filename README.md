My collection of poems - GitHub experiments


1.

Main version

River is a flow, 
sky is blue,
water is running through both.
Stay here, don't fly away.

Alternative version 


Don't chase me, I slept into the rocks.
Flow like a river,
sing into the Fires,
let the blue skies
melt again!

2.

Their thoughts were heavy, 
the sea turned indigo,
I am now getting lighter,
I left from the crossroads!
