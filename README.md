1.

River is a flow,
sky is blue,
water is running through both.

2.

(This is an alternative version of my second poem,
only appearing to the branch named "SecondBranch" )

Red axe, white face,
heavy equipment and swords,
why would you do it?
Stay away from their reasons,
stop seeking the Glory.

Why did you do it?
I warned you,
don't follow their agony.

3.

Earth day, mother day,
different words same entity,
take care of the Roots,
air could be dangerous.


4.

Fire in my dream,
it wasn't red but purple,
I could stand above it and say,
This is magic,
My feelings were cold,
but you made me cry again.
